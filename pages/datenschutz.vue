                <h2>Liability for contents</h2>
                <br >The contents of these pages were created with the greatest care. However, I can not guarantee the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the content. As a service provider I am responsible according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG for own contents on these pages under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. Upon becoming aware of such infringements, this content will be removed immediately.

                <h2>Liability for links</h2>
                <br >This website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I can not assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If we become aware of any infringements, such links will be removed immediately.
